        <p>In a previous life, Kat worked as a helpdesk engineer for an offsite data backup software company and a human film encyclopedia at an independent video store (ask her about foreign horror!). Her hobbies include rock climbing and video games; her obsessions include her two cats.</p>

        <p>After 20 years as an engineer in manufacturing, Jeff is looking to add web development to his tool kit.  While not chasing his two year-old daughter, Jeff likes to hike and root for an endless list of favorite sports teams.  He is not fond of cats.</p>

        <img src="images/will.jpg">
        <p>Before eyeing web development, William was a forklift driver at Lowe's. William quickly realized that retail was not the path for him and decided to attend Code Fellows to jump start his career, and to get his education back on track. He likes to play video and board games in his off time. He is fond of cats.</p>

        <img src="images/matt.jpg">
        <p>Outside of aspiring web development and cat fighting, Matt is a huge soccer fanatic (Go Chelsea), a competitive wrestler at the college club level, and a proud Pole.  Still a student at UW and being 20 years old, Matt is delving into the world of coding and software to see the endless possibilities that his future could take in this field, as he is still trying to discover what career he might enjoy most.  He’s mildly allergic to cats, but you can’t argue with their cute factor.</p>
